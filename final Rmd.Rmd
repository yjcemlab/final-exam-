This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
Load statistical package 
```{r}
library("knitr", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")
library("nycflights13", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")
library("dplyr", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")
library("RSQLite", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")
library("stargazer", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")
library("tidyr", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")

```
Loading four table weather, airplane,airport and flights into mydata
```{r}
my_db <-nycflights13_sqlite()
weather<-tbl(my_db, "weather") %>% collect()
airports <- tbl(my_db, "airports") %>% collect()
planes <- tbl(my_db, "planes") %>% collect()
flights <- tbl(my_db, "flights") %>% 
  collect() %>%
  mutate(canceled = is.na(arr_time))
flights$canceled <- flights$canceled + 0
flights$date <- paste( flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = ".")
weather$date <- paste(weather$year, weather$month, weather$day, sep = ".")
```
creating a table with weather condition and departute delay and cancelations
```{r}
flights.delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(
    delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
    cancel <- sum(canceled)
  )
weather1 <- weather %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(
    temperature <- mean(temp, na.rm = T),
    dew <- mean(dewp, na.rm = T),
    humidity <- mean(humid, na.rm = T),
    wind_direction <- mean(wind_dir, na.rm = T),
    wind_mph <- mean(wind_speed, na.rm = T),
    wind_gusts <- mean(wind_gust, na.rm = T),
    rain <- mean(precip, na.rm = T),
    pressu <- mean(pressure, na.rm = T),
    visibility <- mean(visib, na.rm = T)
  )
data1 <- inner_join(flights.delay, weather1, by = c("date"))
```
ceating a table with airport destination and departure delays and cancelations
```{r}
flights.ad <- flights %>%
  group_by(date,dest) %>%
  summarise(
    delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
    cancel <- sum(canceled)
)
airports.ad <- airports[,1:2]
data2 <- inner_join(flights.ad, airports.ad, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```
creating a table with plane information and departure delays and cancelations
```{r}
flights.plane <- flights %>%
  group_by(date, tailnum) %>%
  summarise(
    delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
    cancel <- sum(canceled)
  )
data3<- inner_join(flights.plane, planes, by = c("tailnum"))
```
For part a, ploting two graphs with delaytime to temperature and cancelation to temperature.Temperature is blue and delay time and cancelation time is red.It can show when the temperature is high, the depature delays and cancelations are likely to happen.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(data1$`delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)`,col="red")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(data1$`temperature <- mean(temp, na.rm = T)`,col="blue")
plot(data1$`cancel <- sum(canceled)`,col="red")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(data1$`temperature <- mean(temp, na.rm = T)`,col="blue")
```
For part b,run two regressions of departure delay on time like month,day,minute and cancelation on month,day and minute. From the result, we can see summer months are more likely to happen delay. For the cancelation,in the summer time, itâ€™s also more likely to happen. There is no significant relationship between days and cancelations.
```{r}
flighttime <- flights%>%
  select(date,minute,contains("time"),canceled,dep_delay)
flighttime1 <- flighttime %>%
  separate(date,c("year", "month", "day","hour")) %>%
  group_by(canceled)%>%
  arrange(dep_time,dep_delay)%>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay))
reg1<-lm(dep_delay~dep_time+month+day+minute, flighttime1)
stargazer(reg1,type="text",title="time on dep_delay regression",out="final.doc")
reg2<-glm(canceled~dep_delay+dep_time+month+day+minute, flighttime1,family=binomial(link = "logit"))
stargazer(reg2,type="text",title="time on cancelation regression",out="final.doc")
```
For part c, run two regressions of departure delay on destination and cancelation on destination. From the result, we can see some cities are more likely to happen cancelation and departure delay, others are not.
```{r}
reg3 <- lm(data2$`delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)`~data2$dest)
stargazer(reg3,type="text",title=" destination on dep_delay regression",out="final.doc")
reg4 <- lm(data2$`cancel <- sum(canceled)`~data2$dest)
stargazer(reg4,type="text",title="destination on cancelation regression",out="final.doc")
```
For part d,run two regressions of departure delay on planes type and cancelation on planes type From the result, we can see the engine types are not statistical significant to influence the departure delay and cancelation and the planes type can influence the delay and cancelations. 
```{r}
reg5<- lm(data3$`delay <- mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)`~data3$year+data3$type+data3$manufacturer)
stargazer(reg5,type="text",title="planes on dep_delay regression",out="final.doc")
reg6<- lm(data3$`cancel <- sum(canceled)`~data3$year+data3$type+data3$manufacturer)
stargazer(reg6,type="text",title="planes on cancelation regression",out="final.doc")
```
In conclusion, we can say in 2013 New York City airport, if temperature is high, in summer vacation time, and on typeRotorcraft planes are more likely to happen delays and cancelations.
